# DrunkenMike

This project we made it between january to may from 2015, but was made with Android canvas.
Now i'm replacing the Android canvas for Libgdx, so be patient for see the final product.


## About the game 

### Story

Drunken Mike was peacefully napping after a long night of drinking, when suddenly something wakes him from his slumber.
It was an alien invasion that had abducted his animals and turned them into mutants to take over the world.
So Drunken Mike jumps into action with his trusty shotgun and wanting to blast all those liberal and hippie aliens
from his beloved country. 


### Gameplay

here you can see a video of the prototype we have now, without Libgdx

#### Final version

The gameplay is a simple shoot and run with touch screen mechanics. 
In which you have to press the enemy to shoot him down. There are different levels to chose from
and also different difficulty settings, that control the amount of enemies or ammo you have. 
Of course the game will be power-ups, amazing sound and so much fun. 

#### Alpha (we are here right now)

For the moment we only have one infinite level, and one enemy, but it's playable.
